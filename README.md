2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

## 📂 Project Structure

Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

```plaintext
test-coze-snakegame/
├── index.html       # The main HTML file
├── snake.js         # JavaScript file containing the game logic
├── style.css        # CSS file for styling the game
```

## 🕹️ How to Play

- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake.
- The objective is to eat the food that appears on the screen.
- Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer.
- Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.

## 📄 Code Overview

### HTML (`index.html`)

The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the game. It includes a canvas element where the game is rendered.

### CSS (`style.css`)

The CSS file provides basic styling for the game. It ensures the canvas is centered on the screen and has a simple background color.

### JavaScript (`snake.js`)

The JavaScript file contains the game logic. It handles the movement of the snake, collision detection, and rendering of the game elements.

## 🎨 Features

- **Responsive Design:** The game adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Simple Controls:** Easy-to-use arrow key controls.
